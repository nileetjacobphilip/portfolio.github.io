                            The main objective of this project was to design and integrate an Interactive plant with the
                            help of electronic components like Arduino and other electronic sensors to make possible
                            interaction with plants. Through various research it is evident that in the modern era
                            people have lost interaction with plant, in-order to bring in more connection between plant
                            and the owner, an interactive system was developed which helps to communicate directly with
                            the plant through output devices connected to plant with the help of Arduino.

                            The interactive plant project aims to provoke people to interact with potted plants, by
                            educating people to have more engagement with their everyday life objects such as plants
                            through the help of electronic devices. By extending an interaction between people and their
                            plant, we aim to build an emotional attachment with them. It is more prominent to display
                            emotional aspects of human character to the plant in order to build more connection with the
                            plant and through this project we strive to achieve strong relationship between plant and
                            their owner.

                            The Interactive plant was implemented with certain procedural methodology that we followed
                            throughout the implementation. Started with an initial build testing the light, heat and
                            moisture sensing and ensured that they worked perfectly when connected. Moved on to building
                            a basic 3 sensor circuit with all the sensors working perfectly. Began to program the basic
                            code for Arduino, then placed and connected it with plants and calibrated the sensors. For
                            the intermediate build, added an RGB LED indicator and connected them into the circuit.
                            Reprogrammed the Arduino to display the status of the plant on the RGB LED indicator. For
                            Further advancement connected an LCD Screen to the circuit to display the reading and other
                            information. Wired the LCD properly with the Arduino and reprogrammed to accommodate the new
                            addition.To expediate more, added a piezo and decorative lights to the circuit. The Piezo
                            from the
                            first plant made a heartbeat sound when the owner held the plant for more duration, while
                            the second plant lit up the entire decorative lights to display the reaction from the care
                            received from the plant owner.

                            This project demonstrates the importance and application of real-time audio visual art to
                            induce or enhance psychedelic effects. Multiverse is a real-time audio visual generative
                            art, that produce psychedelic visuals by altering various frequency levels and other
                            parameters of music. It elaborates the concept that audio-visual reactive art, generated
                            real-time has more effect on human brain known to follow after the ingestion of psychedelic
                            drugs. The piece does not emphasis more on the psychedelic effects nor promote the usage of
                            drugs to induce psychedelic effects, rather opens up a vast topic that studies generative
                            audio-visual art. The project Multiverse focuses more on providing a stand-alone desktop
                            application that has an interactive user interface which allows the user to adjust the video
                            effects in real-time and personalise the visuals based on the users preferences. The paper
                            explores on building an intuitive interactive user interface based application/patch that
                            could be used extensively to understand and relish the psychedelic effects based on personal
                            preferences. In this project, I am focusing more on building a patch that has instinctive
                            interface to twiddle around and explore the
                            various effects of psychedelic art.

                        <p class="para">
                            The Generative Art is categorized into an artform, where the artist creates a piece of art
                            with the help of a specific process which can be either autonomous or real-time generated.
                            In this project I concentrate more on the real- time generation of visual art. The project
                            also focuses on the application of the generative art to understand more about the various
                            frequencies of sound. In Multiverse the visuals are generated real-time on the basis of the
                            various parameters of the music. Being an interactive student, I have understood the true
                            potential of providing an intuitive user interface to the user. An interactive real time
                            audio-visual generative art integrated interface
                            delivered to the user induce more psychedelic effect than a usual psychedelic video being
                            played on a screen.

                            yarn. There are different varieties of hand embroidery stitches, most of which cannot be

                            companion iPad application. Hololens app will guide the user in doing stitches by augmenting

                            will progress within the app on various levels. The difficulty level increases with each
                            level. We also believe that having various levels would improve the overall learning
                            experience. Instead of overwhelming the user with all the exercises at once, they will have
                            to complete steps one by one. However, we believe that there is room for improvement there.
                            We will have to do more user tests and then improvise the logic by which we deliver content.

                            our curious consciousness and sparks a fire that illuminates who we have always wanted to
                            be. The attached image shows some street musicians performing at the banks of Shannon River
                            on a fine evening. Street performing has existed for centuries. It has been part of our
                            everyday lives since human society has existed. Street performance has not only been taking
                            place for ages, but has also been occurring in most countries throughout the world. These
                            talented artists were singing some old folk songs and playing some country music to earn a
                            living. I could totally relate the image to the phase of life where some talented artist
                            make their livelihood with their performances.

                            Photo 3: Life is like a river, it is always flowing, it can flow slowly or it can flow
                            quickly, it can change courses but nothing can stop the river from flowing. The same happens
                            with life, there are no external circumstances that can stop it from flowing. No matter what
                            happens in your life, it always goes on. The flowing water, the changing colours of the
                            mighty sky, the formation of clouds taking new shape, new life every now and then with the
                            energy of sunlight.

                            Photo 4: In India, millions of self-employed workers, use the street to earn a living. Some
                            sell goods, such as sweets or vegetables, tea or toys. In the months leading up to
                            festivals, many make kites or sculpt votive images of gods and goddesses on the sidewalk.
                            Then there are the poorest of them all: the laborers. With neither capital nor skills, they
                            sell the sweat of their brow. I have taken this image, while I was exploring the street life
                            in India. The picture is a candid shot of a random sweets seller on the street.

                            Photo 5: Birds are some of the most beautiful and inspiring animals that inhabit our planet.
                            Whether you enjoy owning pet birds or observing these feathered creatures in the wild. Birds
                            maintain the delicate balance between plant and herbivore, predator and prey. From the
                            technology of flight, to the invention of zippers modelled on the barbules of feathers,
                            humans have drawn inspiration from birds.
